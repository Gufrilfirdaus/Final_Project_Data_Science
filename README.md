# 🧠 Final Project: Stroke Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository contains my final project for a data science program, where I developed a predictive model to identify the likelihood of a person having a stroke based on health and demographic data.

## 🎯 Objective
To build a machine learning model that can assist in early detection of stroke risk, potentially supporting preventive healthcare decisions.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: Public stroke dataset
- Includes features such as age, hypertension, heart disease, work type, BMI, and smoking status.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- **Python**
- Libraries: `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Scikit-learn`
- Data preprocessing (null handling, encoding, scaling)
- Feature selection using correlation and importance
- Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and others
- Model evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Handling imbalanced classes with resampling techniques (e.g., SMOTE)

## 📈 Key Results
- Best model achieved good balance between precision and recall.
- Feature importance shows age, hypertension, and heart disease as dominant predictors.
- Demonstrates how machine learning can support preventive health diagnostics.
